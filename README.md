# Socket Messaging Library

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Socket Messaging is a Delphi Library for managing a messaging system over TCP/IP sockets between clients and servers or peer to peer programs.

The library can be used in any Delphi project on recent versions of the environment. It uses the TSocket class from System.Net.Socket, threads and generic collections.

To use this library more simply, and obtain the source code you need to use a client and server in your project, with your own interface, without coding, use [this code generator](https://smcodegenerator.olfsoftware.fr/).

A [presentation of the project and its use](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DCB2023-Socket-Messaging-library-and-generator) has been made during the [Delphi Coding Bootcamp 2023](https://serialstreameur.fr/learn-delphi-coding-bootcamp-2023.html).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Socket-Messaging-Library).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.
