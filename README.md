# Socket Messaging Library

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Socket Messaging is a Delphi Library for managing a messaging system over TCP/IP sockets between clients and servers or peer to peer programs.

The library can be used in any Delphi project on recent versions of the environment. It uses the TSocket class from System.Net.Socket, threads and generic collections.

To use this library more simply, and obtain the source code you need to use a client and server in your project, with your own interface, without coding, use [this code generator](https://smcodegenerator.olfsoftware.fr/).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr/socket-messaging-library.html) mostly in French.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Socket-Messaging-Library).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) in the subfolder ./lib-externes/librairies

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Socket-Messaging-Library/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
