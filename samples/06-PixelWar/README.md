# Pixel War sample

If you're familiar with Pixel War, you'll know what it's all about. The original idea was to provide a drawing surface that could be shared between several users and used online.

This example uses [the library](https://socketmessaging.developpeur-pascal.fr/) in a totally transparent way, thanks to the client/server classes and the messages generated by [SM Code Generator](http://smcodegenerator.olfsoftware.fr/).

This sample come from the "[Client server made easy with the Socket Messaging library for Delphi](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DCB2023-Socket-Messaging-library-and-generator)" session of the [Coding Bootcamp 2023](https://learndelphi.org/coding-bootcamp-2023/).

A replay of [the full presentation](https://serialstreameur.fr/client-server-made-easy-with-the-socket-messaging-library-for-delphi-coding-bootcamp-2023.html) can be seen on [Serial Streamer](https://serialstreameur.fr/).

During the presentation, you were shown an accelerated and slightly cut version of this sample's development. The full version in French is [available on Developpeur Pascal](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/developper-un-espace-de-dessin-a-plusieurs-en-reseau-sous-le-principe-de-la-pixel-war.html).
