# Tchat sample

A simple chat system between several users passing through a server. This example uses [the library](https://socketmessaging.developpeur-pascal.fr/) and [code generator](http://smcodegenerator.olfsoftware.fr/) to set up messages and classes for the server and client.

This sample come from the "[Client server made easy with the Socket Messaging library for Delphi](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DCB2023-Socket-Messaging-library-and-generator)" session of the [Coding Bootcamp 2023](https://learndelphi.org/coding-bootcamp-2023/).

A replay of [the full presentation](https://serialstreameur.fr/client-server-made-easy-with-the-socket-messaging-library-for-delphi-coding-bootcamp-2023.html) can be seen on [Serial Streamer](https://serialstreameur.fr/).

During the presentation, you were shown an accelerated and slightly cut version of this sample's development. The full version in French is [available on Developpeur Pascal](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/developpement-d-un-espace-de-discussion-a-plusieurs-en-reseau-avec-sm-code-generator.html).
